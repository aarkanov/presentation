    %aside.notes
      %ul
        %li Document not what you are going to do but what you did
        %li worry about customers and their value (customer centric test planning)
        %li make sure what you look at is important to you customer, not to you
        %li only document what you need to remember
        %li 10 minute test plan
        %li minimum value that needs to be met.
        %li insert value statements
        %li attributes, capabilities and components
        %li do exploratory testing in a time box fashion
        %li do pairing with product owners/users
        %li you are not writing tests, you are recording your experimentation
        %li write observations whil you are doing it, not after.
        %li after action review: what went right, observations, what didn't, what can we improve.
        %li validation and verficiation should be part of regression, exploratory testing is ours.
