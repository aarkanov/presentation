        <li>Appium is an open source test automatiom framework for use with native and hybrid mobile apps</li>
        <li>It drives iOS and Android apps using the WebDriver JSON Wire Protocol</li>
        <li>Large community</li>
        <li>Frequent releases</li>
        <li>lots of support</li>
        <li>allowed us to leverage our Selenium knowledge</li>

    }</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <ul>
        <li>We used TestNG to write the actual tests</li>
        <li>As a department we have been using to TestNG as the preffered tool for writing and executing tests</li>
        <li>Allows for the tests to sit together with the code and run together with the code</li>
        <li>this provides us with quicker feedback re any regression in the code</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The other tool we used was developed specifically for AngularJS</li>
        <li>Protractor is an end-to-end test framework</li>
        <li>It runs tests against your application running in a real browser</li>
        <li>It interacts as user would</li>
        <li>Since our app was hybrid, using protractor allowed us to run multiple functional tests in a fast manner</li>
        <li>while running sanity tests on real devices</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Monkey test was another approach we had to make sure our apps were stable</li>
        <li>A monkey test runs with no specific test in mind</li>
        <li>It would enter random strings into boxes</li>
        <li>Click on random boxes</li>
        <li>Open and close the app</li>
        <li>Attempt to open other apps and then our app</li>

      <ul>
        <li>For iOS we decided that we will support iPhone 4,5 and iPad 2 and up</li>
        <li>We currently have iPhone 4,5,3gs and iPad 2 as test devices</li>
        <li>For Android we needed a bit of a different approach due the vast spectrum of devices and OS</li>
        <li>We decided we will support OS 4.0 and up</li>
        <li>In order not to purchase 200 devices, we chose to have a low end and a high end device</li>
        <li>and make the assumption that if the app works on those, it will work on everything in between</li>

        <li>This is what the Appium setup looks like</li>
        <li>We use Git to store all our test code</li>
        <li>Bamboo to allow us to run the tests whenever we want</li>
        <li>We have a selenium server that allows us to have multiple devices connected to appium</li>
        <li>and we have the appium servers running on the Mac machines that correspond to every device</li>
