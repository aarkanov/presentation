      So where did all of this mobile testing talk start?
      2012 plans are announced to make a mobile app

        <li>Allows for the tests to sit together with the code and run together with the code</li>

        <li>The other tool we used was developed specifically for AngularJS</li>
        <li>Protractor is an end-to-end test framework</li>
        <li>It runs tests against your application running in a real browser</li>
        <li>It interacts as user would</li>
        <li>Since our app was hybrid, using protractor allowed us to run multiple functional tests in a fast manner</li>

        <li>Click on random boxes</li>

        <li>We currently have iPhone 4,5,3gs and iPad 2 as test devices</li>
        <li>For Android we needed a bit of a different approach due the vast spectrum of devices and OS</li>
        <li>We decided we will support OS 4.0 and up</li>
        <li>In order not to purchase 200 devices, we chose to have a low end and a high end device</li>
        <li>and make the assumption that if the app works on those, it will work on everything in between</li>

        <li>This is what the Appium setup looks like</li>
        <li>We use Git to store all our test code</li>
        <li>Bamboo to allow us to run the tests whenever we want</li>
        <li>We have a selenium server that allows us to have multiple devices connected to appium</li>
